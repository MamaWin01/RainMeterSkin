## Elementary

Some simple, clean [Rainmeter][rainmeternet] skins.

These skins were built and tested using Rainmeter version _4.0.0_, and the installer requires version 4.0.0 or later.
You can download the latest version of Rainmeter from [Rainmeter.net][rainmeternet].
The RMSKIN installer package for these skins can be downloaded from [DeviantArt][devart] or [GitHub][gh-releases].
